<h2>Stuck in the Belt</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
You are stuck in the asteroid belt. You must survive for as long as possible. More asteroids will come as time goes along.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I made the asteroids come from all directions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest part was keeping track of 50 asteroids
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I found open sources from a google search and modified them a little bit in photoshop.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Survive to get home.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Move the mouse around to avoid the asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Survive!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are trying to get home after a long journey is space. But you fell asleep for a moment. You wake up when your ship gets rocked (see what I did there?) and you realized you messed up.... BIG TIME. You now have to survive through the asteroid belt to home. You look for directions but you find out your GPS system is broken... Good luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone looking for a simple game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 20-100 seconds depending on skill. After 100, there are too many asteroids.
</li>
